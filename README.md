**Introduction**
 The road accident analysis project aims to systematically collect, analyze, and present data related to road accidents in order to identify key patterns, risk factors, and causes of accidents. By examining different variables such as accident severity, causes, weather conditions, road types, and more, this report offers insights into how these factors contribute to road accidents. The ultimate goal is to provide evidence-based recommendations that can help reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve road safety.
**Objective**
The main objectives of the road accident analysis project are:
 1.To analyze accident data based on various factors like location, time, severity, and cause.
 2.To identify the most frequent causes and contributing factors of road accidents.
 3.To evaluate how environmental conditions (e.g., weather, road conditions) affect accident outcomes.
 4.To identify high-risk times, locations, and road types that require special attention.
 5.To present findings in a clear and actionable format, offering recommendations for improving road safety.
**Conclusion:**
This project has provided valuable insights into the patterns, causes, and severity of road accidents. By identifying high-risk factors and offering actionable recommendations, the findings can help guide policy changes, infrastructure improvements, and public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing accidents and enhancing road safety. Further studies and continuous monitoring of road accident data will ensure ongoing improvements in traffic safety.
